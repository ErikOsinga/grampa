# Gaussian Random-fields Approximation for Magnetic-fields with Python Algorithms (GRAMPA)

Modelling magnetic fields as Gaussian random fields following a certain power spectrum and electron density profile as explained in Murgia+2004.
Built for analysing Faraday rotation experiments of Galaxy clusters but could be more generally used for other magnetised plasmas depending on the properties. 

magneticfieldmodels.ipynb shows an example for educational purposes.
